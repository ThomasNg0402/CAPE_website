            <h2>What is it truly about?</h2>
            <p class="headlineparagraph">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease 
                caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. 
                The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
                During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".
                the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus". 
                This nickname was due to many diseases being referred to by its geographical location
                 (Zika virus, Spanish Flu, etc.) in the past.
                 This name would cause potential social stigma against China and Asians in general,
                 thus in January 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended 
                 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease
                 as interim names per 2015 guidance and international guidelines 
                 against using geographical locations or groups of people in disease and virus names.
                 The official names

            <div class="highlight">COVID‑19</div> and <div class="highlight">SARS-CoV-2</div>
            were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020 with

            <h2>Medical data on COVID-19</h2>
            <p>
                COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 
                'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2).
                Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a <strong class="symptom">novel</strong> (not previously recorded)
                severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 
                It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia 
                connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
                All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle 
                occur in related coronaviruses in nature,
                particularly in Rhinolophus sinicus aka Chinese horseshoe bats.
                <br>
                Outside the human body, 
                the virus is destroyed by household soap which bursts its protective bubble.
                <br>
            </p>
            <div class="highlight">Hospital disinfectants, alcohols, heat, povidone-iodine, and ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation</div>
            are also effective disinfection methods for surfaces.
            <br>
            <p>
                SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
                It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. 
                Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. 
                It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
                <br>
                The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include 
                membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). 
                The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is about 98% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, 
                maintains around 98% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; 
                whereas, the similarity is only around 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV.
                <br>
                <br>
                The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages.
                The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by 
                <a href="https://gisaid.org" target="_blank">GISAID</a>, <a href="https://nextstrain.org/" target="_blank">Nextstrain</a> and <a href="https://pangolin.cog-uk.io/" target="_blank">Pango</a>.
                <br>
                The expert group convened by the WHO recommended the labelling of variants using letters of the Greek alphabet,
                 for example, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma, 
                 giving the justification that they 
                 "will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences."
                 Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), 
                 while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR).
                 The Pango tool groups variants into lineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage.
                 Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged throughout 2020, 
                 for example Cluster 5 in Denmark which emerged among minks and mink farmers,
                 and after strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, 
                 the cluster was assessed to no longer be circulating among humans in Denmark as of 1 February 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of December 2021, there are five dominant variants of SARS-CoV-2 spreading among global populations:
                <br>
                 <strong class="symptom">Alpha variant</strong> (B.1.1.7, formerly called the UK variant), first found in London and Kent,
                 <br> 
                 <strong class="symptom" >Beta variant</strong> (B.1.351, formerly called the South Africa variant), 
                 <br>
                 <strong class="symptom">Gamma variant</strong> (P.1, formerly called the Brazil variant), 
                 <br>
                 <strong class="symptom">Delta variant</strong> (B.1.617.2, formerly called the India variant),
                 <br>
                 <strong class="symptom">Omicron variant</strong> (B.1.1.529), which had spread to 57 countries as of 7 December.
                 <br>
                 On December 19, 2023, the WHO declared that another distinctive variant, 
                 JN.1, had emerged as a "variant of interest." 
                 Though the WHO expects an increase in cases globally, particularly for countries entering winter, 
                 the current overall global health risk (as of December 21, 2023) remains low.

            <h1 class="headliner display-2">Symptoms</h1>
            <h2>Symptoms of COVID-19</h2>
            <p>Covid-19 symptoms depend on the variant contracted and person infected, however the most common symptoms include</p>
            <div class="highlight symptom">coughing, fever, loss of smell (medical term: anosmia), and loss of taste (medical term: ageusia).</div>
            Less common symptoms include 
            <div class="symptom">headaches, nasal congestion & runny nose, muscle pain, sore throat, diarrhea, 
            eye irritation, toes swelling / turning purple,</div>
            and in moderate to severe cases,
            <strong>breathing difficulties.</strong>
            People with the COVID-19 infection may have different symptoms, 
            and their symptoms may change over time. 
            <br>
            Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified:
            <br> 
            1) <div class="symptom">Respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum (commonly referred to as phlegm), 
            shortness of breath, and fever; </div>
            <br>
            2) <div class="symptom">A musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue;</div> 
            <br>
            3) <div class="symptom">A cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.</div>
            <br>
            <p>
                At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus <strong class="symptom">do not develop noticeable symptoms</strong> at any point in time.
                These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested and can still spread the disease.
                 Other infected people will develop symptoms later (called "pre-symptomatic") 
                or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus.
                As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. 
                The median (average) delay for COVID-19 is four to five days possibly being infected for 1-4 of those days.
                Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, 
                and almost all will experience at least one symptom within 12 days.
                <br>
                Most people recover from the acute phase of the disease. 
                However, some people continue to experience a range of effects, 
                such as fatigue, for months, even after recovery.
                <br>
                This is the result of a condition called long COVID, 
                which can be described as a range of persistent symptoms that continue for weeks or months at a time.
                Long-term damage to organs has also been observed after the onset of COVID-19. 
                Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the potential long-term effects of the disease.

            <h2>Common diagnosis for COVID-19</h2>
            <p>
                COVID‑19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms 
                and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 
                or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions.
                long with laboratory testing, 
                chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection.

            <p>
                The standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests,
                which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.
                As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its "ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited."
                <strong class="highlight">
                    Commonly referred to as a swab test,
                </strong>
                the test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab (Swab for back of nose and throat); 
                however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.
                Results are generally available within hours or minutes, with a common self-taken test from a test kit taking about 15-20 minutes.
                Several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. 
                Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.
                The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed out that 
                "a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine 
                or discharge from hospital are not infectious, 
                but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with" 
                and have called for 
                "an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing".
                In September 2020, 
                the UK government issued "guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories 
                to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, 
                when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results".

                A common way to self-diagose COVID-19 without going to a clinic or hospital is to use a self-test kit.
                It usually uses a nasal swab, a liquid solution, and a small one-time use device that shows the result.

                Chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 
                in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection 
                but are not recommended for routine screening.
                Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities

                Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a 
                peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution 
                are common in early infection.
                Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), 
                and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
                Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include 
                asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions.
                Many groups have created COVID‑19 datasets that include 
                imagery such as the Italian Radiological Society 
                which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
                Due to overlap with other infections such as 
                adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of 
                limited specificity in identifying COVID‑19.
                A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR 
                and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, 
                it is faster and more sensitive.

                Those diagnosed with COVID‑19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
                to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue,

                Vaccines
            </div>
            <p>
                The first COVID‑19 vaccine was granted regulatory approval on 2 December 2020 
                by the UK medicines regulator MHRA.
                It was evaluated for emergency use authorisation (EUA) status by the US FDA, 
                and in several other countries.
                Initially, the US National Institutes of Health guidelines 
                do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID‑19, 
                before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 
                outside the setting of a clinical trial.
                Without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, 
                a key part of managing COVID‑19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, 
                known as "flattening the curve".
                This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of active cases, 
                and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available.

                which resolve without medical treatment within a few days.
                COVID‑19 vaccination is safe for people who are pregnant or are breastfeeding.
                Side effects throughout the body (such as fever, chills, tiredness, and headache) 
                are more common after the second dose of a 
                Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Novavax COVID-19 vaccine.
                Severe allergic reactions to all vaccines are rare but can happen.
                There is a rare risk of myocarditis and pericarditis (inflammation in heart muscle and heart outer lining respectively) associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, mostly among males ages 12–39 years. The rare risk may be further reduced with a longer interval between the first and second dose.
                Cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have also been reported in people who received Novavax COVID-19 vaccine.
                Symptoms of myocarditis & pericarditis include:

                <br>
                In community and healthcare settings, 
                the use of face masks is intended as source control to limit tran
                smission of the virus 
                and for personal protection to prevent infection.
                Properly worn masks both limit the respiratory droplets and aerosols spread by infected individuals 
                and help protect healthy individuals from infection.
                Masks vary in how well they work, with N95 and surgical masks outperforming cloth masks,
                but even cloth masks, with their variability in fabric type and mask fit, 
                provide wearers with substantial protection from particles carrying COVID-19.
                Among readily available fabrics, double-layered cotton, hybrid masks, and cotton flannel perform best,
                and filtration effectiveness generally improves with thread count.
                Healthcare workers, given their exposure, are recommended against using cloth masks.

                <strong class="prevent highlight">Indoor ventilation and avoiding crowded indoor spaces</strong>
                <br>
                The CDC states that avoiding crowded indoor spaces reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection.
                When indoors, increasing the rate of air change, 
                decreasing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air can reduce transmission.
                The WHO recommends ventilation and air filtration in public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols.
                Exhaled respiratory particles can build-up within enclosed spaces with inadequate ventilation. 
                The risk of COVID‑19 infection increases especially in spaces 
                where people engage in physical exertion or raise their voice 
                (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing) 
                as this increases exhalation of respiratory droplets. 
                Prolonged exposure to these conditions, 
                typically more than 15 minutes, leads to higher risk of infection.
                Displacement ventilation with large natural inlets can move stale air directly 
                to the exhaust in laminar flow while significantly reducing the concentration of droplets and particles. 
                Passive ventilation reduces energy consumption and maintenance costs 
                but may lack controllability and heat recovery. 
                Displacement ventilation can also be achieved mechanically with higher energy and maintenance costs. 
                The use of large ducts and openings helps to prevent mixing in closed environments. 
                Recirculation and mixing should be avoided because recirculation prevents 
                dilution of harmful particles and redistributes possibly contaminated air, 
                and mixing increases the concentration and range of infectious particles and keeps larger particles in the air.

                <br>
                Thorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required.
                The WHO also recommends that individuals 
                wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, 
                especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, 
                before eating and after blowing one's nose.
                When soap and water are not available, 
                the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol.
                For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, 
                the WHO provides two formulations for local production. 
                In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol. 
                Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; 
                it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis." Glycerol is added as a humectant.

                Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes 
                infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease 
                by minimising close contact between individuals. 
                Methods include 
                quarantines; 
                travel restrictions; 
                and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. 
                Individuals may apply social distancing methods by 
                staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, 
                and physically distancing themselves from others.
                In 2020, outbreaks occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing.
                In the United States, the prisoner population is ageing 
                and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID‑19 
                due to high rates of coexisting heart and lung disease,

                <br>
                After being expelled from the body, 
                coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days. 
                If a person touches the dirty surface, 
                they may deposit the virus at the eyes, nose, or mouth where it can enter the body and cause infection.
                Evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of COVID‑19,
                leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues 
                such as the increase of antimicrobial resistance through the use of 
                inappropriate cleaning products and processes.
                Deep cleaning and other surface sanitation has been criticised as hygiene theatre, 
                giving a false sense of security against something primarily spread through the air.
                COVID-19 survives the longest when the temperature is room-temperature or lower, 
                and when relative humidity is low (below 50%).
                On many surfaces, 
                including glass, some types of plastic, stainless steel, and skin, 
                the virus can remain infective for several days 
                indoors at room temperature, or even about a week under ideal conditions.
                On some surfaces, including cotton fabric and copper, 
                the virus usually dies after a few hours.
                The virus dies faster on porous surfaces than on non-porous surfaces 
                due to capillary action within pores and faster aerosol droplet evaporation.
                However, of the many surfaces tested, two with the longest survival times are N95 respirator masks and surgical masks, 
                both of which are considered porous surfaces.
                The CDC says that in most situations, 
                cleaning surfaces with soap or detergent, not disinfecting, 
                is enough to reduce risk of transmission.
                The CDC recommends that if a COVID‑19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility 
                such as an office or day care, all areas such as 
                offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like 
                tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs 
                used by the ill persons should be disinfected.

                <br>
                A 2021 Cochrane rapid review found that 
                based upon low-certainty evidence, 
                international travel-related control measures such as 
                restricting cross-border travel 
                may help to contain the spread of COVID‑19.
                Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases.
                While test-based border screening measures may be more effective, 
                it could also miss many positive cases 
                if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up. 
                The review concluded that a minimum 10-day quarantine may be beneficial 
                in preventing the spread of COVID‑19 
                and may be more effective if combined 
                with an additional control measure like border screening.
